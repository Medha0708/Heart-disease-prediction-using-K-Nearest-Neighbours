# Heart-disease-prediction-using-K-Nearest-Neighbours
Preventing heart disease has become increasingly crucial. To promote healthier lives for a greater number of individuals, employing effective data-driven techniques for foreseeing cardiac issues can significantly enhance both research and preventive measures. Machine learning plays a pivotal role in achieving this goal, accurately predicting heart conditions.

The project entails essential steps like processing and analyzing patient data related to heart disease. The model employed in this endeavor is trained using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm.

The KNN method operates on the premise that new cases and existing cases can be compared, and it assigns the new instance to the category most closely resembling the existing ones. When a new data point is introduced, the KNN algorithm categorizes it based on its similarity to already stored data. This means that by applying the KNN method, new data can be swiftly and accurately placed into the appropriate category. 

The dataset comprises the following features: 
age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol levels (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg), maximum heart rate achieved during exercise (thalach), exercise-induced angina (exang), ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak), slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope), number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca), and type of defect (thal).  Additionally the target variable can assume two values 1 or 0, 1 implying that the patient has heart disease whereas 0 signifies he/she doesn't have heart disease.
